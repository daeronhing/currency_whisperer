## Future Implementations
If you have idea or suggestion on how to improve the bot, please feel free to create issues.

There are some ideas I collected, maybe these features will appear in the future, depends on my schedule:
1. Locate user's current location and show the nearest money changer
2. User can specify a target rate, and a notification will be sent when the exchange rate reach the target rate
3. A algorithm to predict the currency exchange rate
